    <br>
    This specific program was made to calculate the prices of theoretically weather a city garbage plan was cheaper or a private one was cheaper <br>
    <br>
    <code>
    //calculate private company cost<br>
    privbags = (int)((trashgallons - privcontainercap)/privbagcap+0.99);<br>
    privcompanycost = privcontainerprice + (privbags * privbagprice);<br>
    <br>
    //calculate city cost<br>
    lgcitybags = trashgallons/lgcitycap;<br>
    remaingallons = trashgallons % lgcitycap;<br>
    medcitybags = remaingallons/medcitycap;<br>
    remaingallons = trashgallons % medcitycap;<br>
    smallcitybags = (remaingallons/smallcitycap)+0.99;<br>
    citycost = lgcitybags * lgcityprice + medcitybags * medcityprice + smallcitybags * smallcityprice;<br>
    </code>
    <br>
    Above was how the program calculates the individual prices of the city plan and the private company plan. <br>
    I collected inputs from code not seen here things like <code>trashgallons</code> and every other variable is imputed by hand when the program runs. <br>
